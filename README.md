### piano drops 
The game is ready as a primitive. The objective of the game is to catch the falling objects as they fall on the game board. The game board is demarcated into sections, where each section corresponds to a key on the keyboard. As the object in on the board, each correct press will yield a point and each incorrect press will take away a life.Â 
 
### snake
Intended as an implementation of the snake game. As of now, it is empty of mechanics and has only menu UI.
